      <h2>Greetings!</h2>
      <p>Hello, and welcome to my portfolio. My name Sonali Najera, I'm a queer Californian developer! A lot of my interests include but are not limited to: queer culture,
        biology, and art. I consider my life to be quite stellar and there's so much I would like to share! Here are a few quick things about me:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>I'm a transgender person of color and I use they/them pronouns.</li>
        <li>I enjoy working with queer non-profits to get their development needs met</li>
        <li>I'm living the California Dream from San Francisco, but I am more than happy to work remotely for you!</li>
      </ol>
      <p>If I am the one you seek, continue reading.</p>

      <h2>About Me </h2>

      <p>As I mentioned above, I am a queer person that enjoys working for and with queer organizations. My journey began while attending UC Berkeley, where I got my degree
        in Molecular and Cell Biology. I worked in labs for a while but found the lack of community disheartening. I moved to San Francisco and made my way through the tech field. A lot of my early work was with education and tech, but I quickly realized that I needed to be on the learner side! Insert Thinkful! With their help I launched my developer career and used my powers for the good of the people.</p>

      <p>As I made my career a reality I started to see a huge gap in access to resources for queer orgs. Mainly, a lot of essential queer orgs had underdeveloped and underwhelming web pages. I saw an opportunity to give back, improve, automate, and bring forward their presence. I'm proud to know that I was able to serve the following communities:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Underrepresented groups of color</li>
        <li>LGBTQ+ </li>
        <li>Sex workers</li>
      </ul>

      <p>I do want to clarify that these are not the only communities I work with. However, these communities are largely underserved, underfunded and are not shown compassion. I have the opportunity to bridge them to the current forms of communication that improve outreach and productivity. If you're a developer, I hope you consider doing the same. If you're looking for a developer, then I hope you have found what you're looking for.</p>

      <h2>What I'm currently working on</h2>
      <p>I currently work for a friend's magazine, Cherry mag. She started the project as part of a college assignment. I originally joined as a content contributor. You can read one of my articles <a href="https://www.cherrymagazine.net/blog/2019/5/13/dating-while-trans" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

      <!-- this is a goal for me but putting this here for the puposes of the excercise-->
      <p>As my skills as a developer improved, I started to manage their webpage. Iâ€™ve learned a lot more about style, fashion, and SEO. It has been a rewarding experience and I am proud of the work we have accomplished together.</p>
